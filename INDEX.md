## 📈 Success Metrics

After completing refactoring:

| Metric | Target | How to Verify |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Bundle size | -15-20% | Run `npm run build` and check output |
| Code duplication | -40-50% | Visual code review or tool like CodeClimate |
| Component size | 100-150 lines avg | Check file sizes |
| Test coverage | 70-80% | Run test suite |
| Language routing | ✅ Works | Visit /en and /ar URLs |
| Fonts | ✅ Switch correctly | Check DevTools styles |

---

## 🚨 Critical Checklist Before Starting

- [ ] All new files created (hooks/, components/shared/, middleware.ts)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors on build
- [ ] Language routing works (/en and /ar)
- [ ] Fonts load correctly for both languages
- [ ] Can import hooks without errors
- [ ] Can import shared components without errors
- [ ] Documentation files exist and readable

If any item fails, check [IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md) troubleshooting section.
